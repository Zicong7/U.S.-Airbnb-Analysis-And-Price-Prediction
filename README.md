# U.S.-Airbnb-Analysis-And-Price-Prediction
Exploring Airbnb listings from the USA and Making Price Prediction


Airbnb is a game-changer in traditional hospitality businesses, providing guests with a more distinctive and personalized option of traveling and experiencing the world. We'd want to explore the pricing listings in the Manhattan area and develop a price prediction for travelers to use when deciding where to stay. In addition, we'd want to dig into the common features of popular listings and make some recommendations to (prospective)/ hosts on how to make their listings popular.

Our dataset comes from the U.S. Airbnb Open Data source in Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kritikseth/us-airbnb-open-data), which originally is a compilation of multiple datasets found on Inside Airbnb. (http://insideairbnb.com/index.html). This dataset provides us the information of Airbnb listings in the U.S. with attributes including the ID, name, room type(Entire home, shared room, private room, Hotel room), and price of the listing; ID and name of the host; where the listing located at (neighborhood, latitude-longitude, city), reviews, and the number of days in a year the listing is available for rent.
